# AIPaperPiano

## Description
AIPaperPiano allows you to play on a virtual piano. All you need is a laptop with a webcamera and two A4 sheets (and a table of course:). <br />
Here I used the Python programming language, Tensorflow, NumPy and Seaborn libraries, and the PyQt5 graphics library. <br />
During the development of the project I learnt and practiced such concepts as transfer learning, fine tuning, data augmentation, active learning, learning rate scheduler. I also had experience with Google Colab.
